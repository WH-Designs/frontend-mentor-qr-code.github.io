## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this beginning project I used it as a good tool to strengthen my Tailwind CSS understanding, and I leanred how to properly make a container responsive to the screen changing sizes.

### Continued development

For future projects I want to focus on keeping responsiveness as my number one priority as well as keeping the style polished and readable.
